## System Operational Concept (OpsCon) <a name="OpsCon"></a>
<b> Assigned: </b> Seif Diaa

<p> The system operational concept outlines how the proposed electronics inventory database system will function and interact with different users and components. It describes the core operations and interactions within the system to provide a comprehensive understanding of its functionality. The following is a high-level overview of the system operational concept: </p>

### 1. User Roles:
<b> The system will support different user roles with varying levels of access and privileges. The key user roles include: </b>
- Distributor: Responsible for managing the inventory, manufacturers, orders, and customers.
- Manufacturers: Provide product information, catalog, and updates to the distributor.
- Customers: Browse products, place orders, and track order status through the distributor's website.

### 2. System Components:
<b> The system will consist of the following main components: </b>
- Database: Stores and manages all data related to products, manufacturers, orders, and customers.
- Website Integration: Provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse products, place orders, and track their order status.
- Reporting and Analytics: Generates various reports, including inventory reports, sales reports, and order history, to support decision-making and analysis.

### 3. System Workflow:
<b> The operational workflow of the system can be summarized as follows: </b>
- Product Management: The distributor adds new products to the inventory database, including specifications, pricing, and stock levels. They can update or delete existing product information as needed. The system tracks stock levels and sends notifications when inventory falls below a predefined threshold.
- Manufacturer Management: The distributor maintains a database of manufacturers, including their contact information and product catalog. Manufacturers provide updates to the distributor regarding product changes, availability, and other relevant information.
- Order Management: Customers place orders through the distributor's website. The system captures order details, including products ordered, quantities, delivery addresses, and order status. The distributor processes the orders, including picking, packing, and shipping operations. The system generates order confirmations and invoices. Customers can track their order status through the website.
- Customer Management: The distributor maintains a customer database, including contact details, order history, and preferences. They can add, update, or delete customer records as needed. The system allows searching and filtering of customer information based on various criteria.
- Reporting and Analytics: The system provides reporting capabilities to generate inventory reports, sales reports, and order history. Users can customize reports based on specific criteria and parameters. Data visualization and graphical representations help analyze inventory and sales data.

### 4. System Integration:
The system integrates with the distributor's website seamlessly. The website provides customers with a user-friendly interface to browse products, view details, place orders, and track order status. The system synchronizes product information, stock levels, and order data between the database and the website in real-time.

### 5. Security and Maintenance:
The system implements robust security measures to protect sensitive data, ensuring customer information and order details are securely stored and transmitted. Regular maintenance activities, including backups and system updates, are performed to ensure system availability, reliability, and data integrity.
